/**
 * Module lifecycle tiers.
 *
 * The platform splits installed apps into two tiers:
 *  - **Kernel** (never uninstallable): auth, admin, super-admin, the App Store,
 *    Studio/Builder, Dashboard, and developer/billing infra. These keep an admin
 *    surface available so a user can always re-install everything else.
 *  - **Business modules** (uninstallable): the operational apps below. Uninstalling
 *    one is an *entitlement toggle* — the code stays resident, the data is preserved,
 *    but the module is hidden from the UI and its API is gated off until re-installed.
 *
 * Bundle-backed industry apps (healthcare, education, …) are uninstallable by their
 * own teardown path and are not listed here.
 *
 * Each gated module maps to one or more URL/route segments because a few apps are
 * mounted under a segment that differs from their app slug (e.g. Connect →
 * `communication`). The same map is used by the frontend route guard and the API
 * entitlement middleware so both agree on what "installed" means.
